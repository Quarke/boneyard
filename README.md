# Notes
  I worked on this a bunch yesterday, got navigation working, with input, display, and tab-completion. I think I was using an outdated version of script.json though.

# TODO
  There is still a bunch to do, I can walk you all through the changes for the most part, but I added some comments so it's readable for the most part.

  However, the character, game_state, and enemy classes haven't been touched, so they need to be integrated into gameplay.

  I'm gonna work on it a bit tomorrow as well. Probably get the game_state class built out and somewhat attached to gameplay.
